# Times table game

## Background

We've been trying to teach both my kids their multiplication tables. There are plenty of online games but nothing really simple that is in html (most of them seem to be eeky Flash type things).

Of course it's another excuse to practice some coding.

- Create a product I could share with my kids and maybe their pals
- End-to-end product development
- Demonstrate building a product in an "agile" manner
- Refresh my testing skills with Jasmine

## MVP features

- As a user, I need see a random multiplication question, so I can answer it
- As a user, I need the question to be from any of the 0 - 12 times tables, so that I can provide an answer
- As a user, I need to be able to submit an answer, so that the game can tell me whether I've got the question correct
